> ⚠️ **Note: This project is in early development.**  

A .NET 7.0 solution that provides tooling to inspect and interact with the Plex Media Server SQLite database at a code level. This includes code generation for models and repositories, and example usage for querying your Plex DB directly.

## 📦 Solution Overview

This repository contains three projects:

### 🔹 PlexDbLib
A .NET class library that contains:
- Auto-generated **models**
- **Repositories**
- A `DbContext` for connecting to the Plex SQLite database

> ⚙️ This library is generated by the `PlexStructureGen` project.

---

### 🔹 PlexDbToolsCmd
A simple example console app that:
- Connects to the Plex DB
- Lists out available devices

> 🔧 **Note:** You must update the path to the DB file in `app.config` before running this project.

---

### 🔹 PlexStructureGen
A console app responsible for generating the code in `PlexDbLib`, based on the structure of the Plex database.

---

## 💡 What Problem Does This Solve?

Plex exposes limited options for querying or modifying its internal database programmatically. `PlexDbTools` provides a structured and strongly typed way to:
- Connect to the Plex SQLite database
- Explore its structure
- Generate model/repository code
- Build tools or scripts to work directly with the DB
